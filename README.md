# Java-Pet-Project
This Java project appears to be a simulated pet nurturing game or application, involving multiple concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The core of the project is built around the life, activities, and interactions of pets.
Master Class (Master): This class represents the owner of the pets. It includes the owner's username, password, balance, number of pets, and an array of pets. The main functionalities include displaying pet information, releasing pets, and adopting pets.

Pet Class (Pet): This class represents a pet, containing attributes such as nickname, price, hunger level, stamina, strength, intelligence, and health. The Pet class offers functions like eating, working, resting, and visiting the doctor.

Food Class (Food): This class represents different types of food, each having a different impact on various attributes of the pets.

Specific Pet Classes (Kitty and Pig): These classes inherit from the Pet class and set specific attribute values in the constructor.

Work Class (Work): Represents different types of work, each having a different impact on the pet's attributes.

WorkSpace Class (WorkSpace): Contains multiple workplaces for pets.

Food Shop Class (FoodShop): Represents a shop selling food, offering various types of food.

Pet Shop Class (PetShop): Represents a shop selling pets, offering various types of pets.

Hospital Class (Hospital): Provides medical services for pets.

Additionally, there are several view classes (*View classes), such as FoodShopView, PetShopView, and MasterView, which are likely used to create a user interface, allowing users to interact with the program.

The Java knowledge applied in this project includes:

Basic Java syntax and structure.
Principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), such as class inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
The use of arrays and collections for storing and managing pets, food, and work, etc.
Control flow statements (like if-else, loops) for implementing business logic.
Overall, this project appears to be a comprehensive application that covers multiple aspects of object-oriented programming, making it suitable as a project for practicing and learning Java OOP concepts.
